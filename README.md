# DES on Arduino
DES_on_Arduino is a tiny demo program running on Arduino UNO or UNO series devices. Standard DES software based data encryption is implemented. 

Side Channel Attack is welcome to be performed on Arduino platform. You may need a A-to-C USB over serial cable, so that the console on your Windows/Linux OS is able to communciate with your Arduino properly. Baud rate should be set to 115200, or depends on your Arduino configurations.
